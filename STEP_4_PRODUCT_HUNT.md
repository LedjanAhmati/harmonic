## HUNTER'S FIRST COMMENT (Ready to Copy-Paste)

```
🎼 Hey Product Hunt! 

Launching Harmonic – the world's first deterministic reasoning engine 
built for developers who need AI that actually reasons instead of guessing.

## The Problem We Solved

Traditional AI models are probabilistic black boxes. We created three 
complementary reasoning engines for transparent, auditable AI:

### 1️⃣ Zürich Cycle - Deterministic Logic
A 4-stage reasoning process (input → analysis → synthesis → output) 
with zero neural networks. Every decision is traceable.

### 2️⃣ Trinity Debate - Multi-Persona Reasoning
Five distinct perspectives (Alba, Albi, Jona, Blerina, ASI) reason through 
problems deterministically. Get diverse viewpoints without hallucinations.

### 3️⃣ ASI Fusion - Combined Intelligence
Merges Zürich + Trinity + optional brain memory indexing for 
comprehensive reasoning.

## What's Included

✅ 10 REST API Endpoints (reasoning, auth, system)
✅ Complete OpenAPI 3.0 documentation
✅ Postman collection (10 organized requests)
✅ Production-ready on Vercel
✅ Token-based SaaS authentication
✅ Open source on GitHub

## Why This Matters

- **For Developers**: Predictable reasoning you can integrate into products
- **For Enterprises**: Auditable AI decisions for compliance
- **For Researchers**: Deterministic baseline to benchmark against neural approaches

## Live Demo

Visit: https://harmonic-ledjanahmati.vercel.app

Quick test (replace with your own prompt):
```bash
curl -X POST https://harmonic-ledjanahmati.vercel.app/v1/zurich \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"How do we solve climate change?"}'
```

## Next Steps

- Your feedback shapes our roadmap
- Expanding persona library
- Brain indexing improvements
- Enterprise tier coming Q1 2026

We're building the reasoning layer AI was missing. Let's reason differently!
