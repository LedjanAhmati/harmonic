## 📞 IF YOU GET STUCK

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "remote already exists" | See: GITHUB_PUSH_GUIDE.md |
| "Build failed on Vercel" | Add missing env variables & redeploy |
| "Site shows 404" | Wait 30 sec, hard refresh, check domain |
| "Need Product Hunt copy" | See: PRODUCT_HUNT_SUBMISSION.md |
